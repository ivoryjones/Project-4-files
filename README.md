Visit http://ivoryjones.github.io/Project-4/views/pizza.html to test the project. 

To optimize the speed for pizza.html, I did the following:

Compressed the images using compressnow.com

Added a variable to define the length of pizzaContainer

Inlined style.css and added async to style tag in pizza.html

Tested the speed and got a 95/100 summary for desktop experience and 89/100 for mobile from pagespeed insights

Configured a viewport to scale fonts for mobile experience

For the website, bootstrap-grid.css and main.js have been minified

Changed document.querySelectorAll() to document.getElementsByClassName() for speed optimization
